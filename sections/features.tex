\subsection{FAST-OR Trigger}
\begin{itemize}
	\item each plane generates a FAST-OR trigger if any of the pixels of this plane is hit during a clock cycle (\SI{40}{\MHz})
	\item used to trigger the the whole setup
	\item amplified on the adaptor planes (\ar{fig:pl})
	\item after amplification: \SI{\sim100}{\mV} differential signal
	\item needs to be converted to NIM-signal for the \ac{TU}
	\item every plane needs LEMO out for the FAST-OR
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Read-Out}
\begin{itemize}
	\item telescope read out by a \ac{DTB} that runs on a \SI{40}{\MHz} clock
	\item \ac{DTB} provides clock to the planes
	\item \ac{DTB} receives trigger from the \ac{TU}
	\item \ac{DTB} sends a token-signal that  sequentially passes by the individual planes
	\item \ac{ROC} sends data after receiving the token and issues a new token signal
	\item jumpers on the \ac{MB} next to each plane in order to bypass the plane and send the token directly to the next plane
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[\ra] allows for different configurations and not connected planes
	\end{itemize}
