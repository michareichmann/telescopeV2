\section{Plane Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item telescope has two different setups for the \acp{DUT}
	\item telescope functionality is the same for both setups
	\item \ac{MB} is the same for both setups
	\item planes need stable mounting on the \ac{MB} (either mechanically or with a connector)
\end{itemize}
\fig{.6}{MB}[\ac{MB} Dimensions.]

\subsection{Pad}
\fig{1}{TelPad}[Pad Setup.]
\begin{itemize}
	\item two telescope planes upstream (before the \ac{DUT})
	\item two telescope planes downstream
	\item space of exactly one \ac{MB} in between the two \acp{MB}
	\item \acp{MB} connected to same read-out
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pixel}
\fig{1}{TelPix}[Pixel Setup.]
\begin{itemize}
	\item two telescope planes upstream (before the \ac{DUT})
	\item two telescope planes downstream
	\item three \ac{DUT} planes in the centre
	\item \ac{DUT} planes have separate read-out than the two connected telescope \acp{MB}
\end{itemize}
